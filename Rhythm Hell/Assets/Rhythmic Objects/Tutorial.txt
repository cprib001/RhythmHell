// 4. Play the game





//  - Tutorial - How to delete a Rhythmic Object //

// 1. Select the Rhythmic Object
// 2. Remove the script "Rhythmic Object" or press "Delete from Base" 

// Note: "Delete from Base" will only delete from execution, when you reset the game/editor it will be loaded as Rhythmic Object again.


// Set your custom variables for each GameObject you want (Make sure to deactivate "Use Global Scales" in "Rhythmic Objects" script to use custom values)
